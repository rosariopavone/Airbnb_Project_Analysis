# Airbnb Project Analysis â€“ Sicily Real Estate Insights

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb datasets to find profitable real estate investment opportunities in Sicily. I worked on merging property characteristics, rental prices, occupancy rates, and financial calculations to deliver a data-driven guide for investors targeting the short-term rental market.

## What I Did
- Integrated multiple datasets covering house information, Airbnb pricing, and local rental costs.
- Cleaned and transformed data using Tableau Prep.
- Built dashboards in Tableau Desktop for a clear visualization of investment metrics.
- Calculated adjusted Airbnb ROI and Rent ROI across Sicilian cities and house types.
- Simulated different loan scenarios and occupancy rates to assess investment performance under varying conditions.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python for initial data pre-processing
- Tableau Prep and Tableau Desktop for ETL and dashboard creation
- Excel for financial analysis and simulations
- Git and GitHub for version control
